Patterns im unsure about.

I moved the state of the classes out of the classMakerState and put it back into the form.
Now there is a ClassData instance getting passed around... This does not seem good.
I'm gonna go back to the single item state, held in the provider, I think it will less
confusing and will eliminate the need for callbacks
