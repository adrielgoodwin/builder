# Maker ~ Taurus

### This version is for making simple applications, like an inventory, scheduler or recipe book. 

In a basic application you could probably imagine just two display types for any given data/class/record. 
1. A page or widget containing all the data for the record
   eg. a page with the details (fields) of a recipe: ingredients, total time, kitchen requirements, instructions etc.
2. A small tile containing partial data for the record, usually with a link to its 'full record' page. 
   eg. a tile with the picture and recipe name, which links to the page in the eg above.

##### 1. Create some data classes 
##### 2. Choose what data from those classes is shown in a tile**
