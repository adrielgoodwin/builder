Maker, she is an app that makes apps for all platforms

# why?

There are a bunch of apps I'd love to see exist in the world.
As I have been programming over time, I'm always doing things slightly differently,
causing bugs and headaches whenever a project expands past a certain point. 
At some moment I realized that I could abstract myself out of the equation, and by defining the 
data-classes and a few relationships I just generate the code of an application.
For me this was an exciting, novel idea, so I just jumped right into it. 
Turns out it is a little more complex than I anticipated (no suprise there), but my 
dreams and interest in the puzzle-like aspects of the challenge drove me to continue.
At this point It can only make simple applications with basic relationships.
