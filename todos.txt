### Everything below here is pre Taurus.
just gonna leave it for interests sake...
or maybe cuz it fulfills my hoarder tendencies.


to remember:
if it doesnt work in chrome:
1- Go to flutter\bin\cache and remove a file named: flutter_tools.stamp

2- Go to flutter\packages\flutter_tools\lib\src\web and open the file chrome.dart.

3- Find '--disable-extensions'

4- Add '--disable-web-security'

    # each tile is wrapped in a gesture detector.
    # on tap/touch/click it will go to the page for that particular record
    # *Extra* if the tile contains an instantiation of different class,
      clicking on it (the text/picture of other instantiation) will go to the page for that record

Things to be done, not in any real order


*** Fails when adding a second class.



~ DONE ~ -Install Android Emulator
-Write app to 'new app' location
-~ DONE ~When generating a new class a must-have parameter is 'name'
-Composition Files
    a) To show the data for a record of a class *^
    b) A little tile to show just a couple pieces of data about a class,
    and when you click it it takes you to the full record
    c) The actual app which contains
        1. A drawer with the class names which when clicked go to
        2. *^ The records for that class with an add new button that will
        push the form overtop of the records
    d) alter the form generator to search for class records
        1. For searching and selecting one
        2. For searching and selecting multiple
        3. A button that lets them add a new record of the class right there


simple IO app v 0.1 is just classes in a drawer
1. forms to input data
2. list view of that data

features
1. data-types
    a) String b) numbers c) Class
    only a class can be a list

ui
1. basic text inputs for both strings and numbers
2. for classes, a search box with clickable results appearing below


Future stuff:
display types:
drawer, grid-list with preview of class
visual arrangement of classes based on their relationships/'hierarchical' structure
